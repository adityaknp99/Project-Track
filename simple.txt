2048

The topic of my project is game 2048-the game's objective is to slide 
numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the 
number 2048.

What I exactly did in the code is that it first provides with a grid 
that is filled randomly at two positions with 2.
Program contains 4 basic functions exactly according to the 4 basic 
moves in the game-up,down,right,left.
The job of a particular function was to slide the entries at present 
in the desired direction and then add them if possible and finally
arrange all the entries in the proper manner.
The next task was to check if 2048 is formed or not as if it gets 
formed then you "WIN" the game at that very instant,followed by 
checking that the grid isn't filled and can be operated further as
if this happens then you lose the game.

The program also checks that there has been any change in the grid after
that particular move or not ,as if this does not happen then you need to 
do nothing,if this is also fine then the program fills the grid at any
random position that is vacant with 2 or 4 which is also being randomly
decided but with a greater probability of 2-as in normal game too and
then prints the new grid so that the game continues.
