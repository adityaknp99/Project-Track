2048

This project was assigned to me as a part of ESC101 cousre and I chose
the topic of my course as game 2048-The game's objective is to slide 
numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the 
number 2048.

What I exactly did in the code is that it first provides with a grid 
that is filled randomly at two positions with 2 and then the user beging
playing it with the four basic moves.Program contains 4 basic functions
exactly according to the 4 basic moves in the game-up,down,right,left.
The job of a particular function was to slide the entries at present 
in the desired direction and then add them if possible and finally
arrange all the entries in the proper manner.The next task was to check
if 2048 is formed or not as if it gets formed then you win the game at 
that very instant,followed by checking that the grid isnt filled and 
can be operated further as if this happens then you lose the game.

The program also checks that there has been any change in the grid after
that particular move or not ,as if this does not happen then you need to 
output the exactly same grid with no new random number,if this is also
fine then the program fills the grid at any random position that is 
vacant with 2 or 4 which is also being randomly decided but with a
greater probability of 2-as in normal game too and then prints the new
grid so that the game continues.
